![Cat waving hi](./assets/wave_hi.png#inline) My name is Patricia and welcome to my personal website! I'm a software engineer on the Trust and Safety Team at Pinterest and Code2040 Alumni. Previously, I worked as a backend engineeer at Brigade, a civic tech startup building tools for constituents to hold their elected representatives accountable. In my freetime you can find me salsa dancing, hiking, and watching Formula1.
